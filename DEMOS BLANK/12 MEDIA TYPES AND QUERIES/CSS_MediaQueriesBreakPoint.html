   <!--  Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints 
    in favour of content specific breakpoints, 
    i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.
  With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device 
       — a new iPhone width — 
  because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.

   <!-- 
      1) Pick major breakpoints by starting small, then working up.
       Design the content to fit on a small screen size first, 
       then expand the screen until a breakpoint becomes necessary. 
       This will allow you to optimize breakpoints based on content 
       and maintain the fewest number of breakpoints possible.

      2) Pick minor breakpoints when necessary. 
       In addition to choosing major breakpoints when layout changes significantly, 
       it is also helpful to adjust for minor changes. 
       For example between major breakpoints, 
       it may be helpful to adjust the margins or padding on an element, 
       or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout.
       
       3) Optimize text for reading
        Classic readability theory suggests that an ideal column should contain 
       70 to 80 characters per line (about 8 to 10 words in English), 
       thus each time the width of a text block grows past about 10 words, 
       a breakpoint should be considered.

       4)Never completely hide content
       Be careful when choosing what content to hide or show depending on screen size. 
       Don’t simply hide content just because you can’t fit it on screen. 
       Screen size is not a definitive indication of what a user may want.
